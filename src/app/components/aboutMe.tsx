                <p className="mb-3 text-gray-900 tracking-wide">Hi, I’m <span className='text-red-600 font-bold'>Sabina</span>, a web developer with a passion for crafting seamless, user-focused digital experiences. After over 15 years in customer service, I made a significant career shift into tech, driven by a desire to build solutions that make a real impact. I started with self-learning, but to deepen my expertise, I completed a full-stack bootcamp, which solidified my love for development. </p>

                <p className="mb-3  text-gray-900 tracking-wide">My background in customer service gives me a unique edge — I know how to listen to users and translate their needs into intuitive, polished applications. Whether it’s enhancing existing features or creating new ones, I approach challenges with curiosity and a commitment to continuous improvement.</p>

                <p className="mb-3  text-gray-900 tracking-wide">While I’m open to roles across the stack, front-end development is where I truly thrive. The blend of creativity and precision energizes me, and I love bringing designs to life with pixel-perfect execution. Juggling the world of tech with motherhood, I’m always ready to embrace new challenges and keep learning along the way.</p>

                <p className="mb-3  text-gray-900 tracking-wide">Based in Connecticut, I’m seeking entry-level opportunities, internships, or junior roles where I can contribute and grow.
